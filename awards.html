<div id="reqsbody">
<details>
  <summary>Frank Luther Mott/Kappa Tau Alpha Journalism and Mass Communication Research Award</summary>
  <p>Named in honor of Frank Luther Mott, Pulitzer Prize winner, educator and long-time leader of Kappa Tau Alpha, the award is made for the best research-based book about journalism or mass communication published each year.</p>
  <p>Kappa Tau Alpha, the national college honor society founded in 1910 for scholarship in journalism and mass communication, has recognized research contributions to the field since the inauguration of the award in 1944. The winning author receives a $1000 prize.</p>
  <p>Entries are judged by a panel of university professors of journalism and mass communication and national officers of Kappa Tau Alpha.</p>
  <p>James T. Hamilton's Democracy's Detectives: The Economics of Investigative Journalism is the winner for the best book on journalism and mass communication based on original research published in 2016.</p>
  <p>"Hamilton provides a fresh and compelling look at the value of investigative journalism in our democracy," said Jeff Fruit, president of Kappa Tau Alpha and a contest judge. "He not only develops and analyzes a unique data set of investigations, but also clearly demonstrates the impact that investigative journalism can have through a case study of one Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter.</p>
  <p>Hamilton is the Hearst Professor of Communication at Stanford University. The book is published by Harvard University Press.</p>
  <p>Other finalists were David Greenberg for Republic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency, Sam Lebovic for For Free Speech & Unfree News: The Paradox of Press Freedom in America; and Anthony M. Nadler, Making The News Popular: Mobilizing U.S. News Audiences.</p>
  <p>Books with a 2017 copyright will be received until Dec. 9, 2017. Books with a 2017 copyright received after the entry deadline may be accepted if arrangements are made prior to the deadline.</p>
