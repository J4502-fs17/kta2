Chapters must submit a letter of nomination for an Honorary Member and explain how the nominee qualifies. Students are not eligible for honorary membership.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Alumni</summary>
  <p>Alumni are not eligible for membership except as charter members of the chapter's first initiation class and only if it can be established that they would have met all of the requirements for membership had the university had a KTA chapter when they were students.</p>
