  <h2>Who we are</h2>
  <p>Kappa Tau Alpha is a college honor society that recognizes academic excellence and promotes scholarship in journalism and mass communication.</p>
  <p>Kappa Tau Alpha is the seventh oldest national honor society and was founded in 1910, at the University of Missouri, the world's oldest journalism school. The Society has 96 chapters and has inducted 75,000 outstanding students since its founding. Kappa Tau Alpha is a non-profit organization and is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies, the nation's only certifying agency for college and university honor socities. </p>
  <p>The emblem of Kappa Tau Alpha is the key, the oldest symbol of knowledge and communication. The Greek letters mean, "The Truth Will Prevail."
